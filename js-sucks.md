# Language Flaws
- ASI

- Fails slow
- String concat and typecasting
- Confusing conversion rules
- Dom 0 event handlers
- partial application and .map
- Multiple syntaxes for everything
    - Functions
    - Indexing
- Octal literals
- Date lib issues
- Sold out to the oo crowd

# Ecosystem Flaws
- Google writes the standard
- Microsoft owns the toolchain
    - npm
    - GitHub
    - VSCode
    - TypeScript
- Apple doesn't care
- Many of the biggest frameworks and projects are developed directly by one team or another
- npm and supply chain attacks: too many authors, too little responsibility?
- Worst of both worlds (compiled and interpreted)
    - No binary format!
        - Wasm ain't it

# Not Flaws, but feel like it sometimes
- npm
- Browser support and unlimited backwards compat
    - Babel people are great, but babel itself is a crutch
- Constant churn and reinventing the wheel
